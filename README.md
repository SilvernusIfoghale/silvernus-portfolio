## Installation

Install my-project with npm

Scaffolding Your First Vite Project
Compatibility Note

Vite requires Node.js version 18+ or 20+. However, some templates require a higher Node.js version to work, please upgrade if your package manager warns about it.

```bash
 $ npm create vite@latest
  cd my-project
```

Then follow the prompts!

You can also directly specify the project name and the template you want to use via additional command line options. For example, to scaffold a Vite + Vue project, run:

bash

# npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed:

npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react

You can use . for the project name to scaffold in the current directory.

Community Templates
create-vite is a tool to quickly start a project from a basic template for popular frameworks. Check out Awesome Vite for community maintained templates that include other tools or target different frameworks.

For a template at https://github.com/user/project, you can try it out online using https://github.stackblitz.com/user/project (adding .stackblitz after github to the URL of the project).

You can also use a tool like degit to scaffold your project with one of the templates. Assuming the project is on GitHub and uses main as the default branch, you can create a local copy using:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
